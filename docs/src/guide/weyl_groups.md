# Weyl Groups

The Weyl group is the symmetry group of the root system, generated by reflections through hyperplanes perpendicular to simple roots.

## Basic Operations

Let's use SO(9) = B₄ as an example:

```@example so9
using Kiwi

so9 = SO(9)
vector = Irrep(so9, [1, 0, 0, 0])
nothing # hide
```

### Simple Roots

```@example so9
roots = simple_roots(so9)
length(roots)  # 4
```

### Weyl Reflections

Reflect a weight through a hyperplane perpendicular to a simple root:

```@example so9
weight = Weight(so9, [2, 1, 0, 0])
reflected = weyl_reflection(weight, roots[1])
```

### Dominant Weights

A weight is dominant if all its Dynkin labels are non-negative:

```@example so9
w1 = Weight(so9, [2, 1, 0, 0])
w2 = Weight(so9, [-1, 2, 0, 0])
[is_dominant(w1), is_dominant(w2)]  # [true, false]
```

Every weight can be reflected to a unique dominant weight:

```@example so9
dominant, sign = reflect_to_dominant(w2)
```

## Weyl Group Order

```@example so9
# SO(9) = B₄ has Weyl group of order 2⁴ · 4! = 384
weyl_group_order(so9)
```

## Weyl Orbits

Get all Weyl group images of a weight:

```@example so9
weight = Weight(so9, [1, 0, 0, 0])
orbit = weyl_orbit(weight)

# Dictionary with keys 1 (positive sign) and -1 (negative sign)
[length(orbit[1]), length(orbit[-1])]
```
